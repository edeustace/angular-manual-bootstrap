# Intro

An example of manually bootstrapping an angular app. This allows one to dynamically inject dependencies. Note won't work with karma (although you may only need to add ng-app to the html attribute).

## Running

You need a web server - if you have python do: 

    cd angular-manual-bootstrap
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
